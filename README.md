# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles and configurations for macOS and Linux systems,
along with a bash script for deploying them on new builds.

## macOS

- bash
- .inputrc
- jupyter console & qtconsole
- neofetch
- neovim
- tmux

## Linux

- bash
- compton
- conky
- .inputrc
- firefox
- i3
- jupyter console & qtconsole
- neofetch
- neovim
- polybar
- rofi
- tmux

# Installation

The `deploy.sh` script can be used to quickly make symlinks from the files in
the repository and the locations on your system where each program will look
for them.
